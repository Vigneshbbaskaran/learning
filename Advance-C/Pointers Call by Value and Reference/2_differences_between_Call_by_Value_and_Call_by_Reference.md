# Call By Value	
        * While calling a function, we pass values of variables to it. Such functions are known as “Call By Values”.
        * In this method, the value of each variable in calling function is copied into corresponding dummy variables of the called function.
        * With this method, the changes made to the dummy variables in the called function have no effect on the values of actual variables in the calling function.
        * Thus actual values of a and b remain unchanged even after exchanging the values of x and y.
        * In call by values we cannot alter the values of actual variables through function calls.
        * Values of variables are passes by Simple technique.
