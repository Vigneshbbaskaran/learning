## Loops assignments

1) WaP to print all numbers from 1 to n.  
2) WaP to print all odd numbers and even numbers between 2 given numbers.  
3) Read a number and print its multiplication table.  
4) WaP to read n numbers from user and print their sum.  
5) WaP to read n numbers from user and print the sum of positive numbers and sum of negative numbers seperately.  
6) WaP to read few positive numbers from user until a negative number is entered by the user, and print the sum of the positive numbers. Also print the number of positive numbers entered by the user.  

7) WaP to read few numbers and keep reading until exactly n positive numbers are entered by the user, and print the sum of positive numbers.  
eg., n = 5  
input : 1  -2  -3   4  -5  -3   7   8  -1  -4  -5   9  
output: 29  

8) Write a program to find the factorial of a given number.  
n! = n * n-1 * n-2 * â€¦. 2 * 1  

9) Modify the calculator program to perform the operations continuously until the user chooses not to continue further. Take user's choice as a character y or n (yes or no).  

10) WaP to calculate the product of 2 numbers without using multipliction operator (*).  
eg., input : 4 5  
output : 20 (should be calculated in a repetitive addition method)  

11) WaP to calculate the power of a number raised to another integer without using any readymade features.  
eg., input: 4 5  
output: 1024 (should be calculated in a repetitive product method)
