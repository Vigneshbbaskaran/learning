4. What is Critical section, deadlocks, race around condition are problems that happen
in thread synchronization?

       The critical section in a code segment where the shared variables can be accessed.
    Atomic action is required in a critical section i.e. only one process can execute in its critical section at a time.
    All the other processes have to wait to execute in their critical sections.
    
        Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked
    because each process is holding a resource 
    and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. 
    
        Race conditions in software or any system occur 
    when the desired output requires that certain events occur in a specific order 
    but that the events don't always happen in that order
