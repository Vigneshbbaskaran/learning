How threads communicate with each other?


       The  pthread_create()  function  starts  a  new  thread  in the calling
       process.  The new thread starts execution by invoking  start_routine();
       arg is passed as the sole argument of start_routine().

      
       The pthread_join() function waits for the thread specified by thread to
       terminate.  If that thread has already terminated, then  pthread_join()
       returns immediately.  The thread specified by thread must be joinable.

       If  retval  is  not NULL, then pthread_join() copies the exit status of
       the target thread (i.e., the value that the target thread  supplied  to
       pthread_exit(3)) into the location pointed to by retval.  If the target
       thread was canceled, then PTHREAD_CANCELED is placed  in  the  location
       pointed to by retval.
