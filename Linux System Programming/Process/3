how to create a new process?
    A new process can be created by the fork() system call. 
    The new process consists of a copy of the address space of the original process. 
    fork() creates new process from existing process. Existing process is called the parent process and the process is created newly is called child process. 
    The function is called from parent process. Both the parent and the child processes continue execution at the instruction after the fork(),
    the return code for the fork() is zero for the new process,
    whereas the process identifier of the child is returned to the parent.
