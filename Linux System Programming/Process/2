1. fork() :
        Fork() is system call which is used to create new process. 
        New process created by fork() system call is called child process and process that invoked fork() system call is called parent process.
        Code of child process is same as code of its parent process. Once child process is created,     
        both parent and child processes start their execution from next statement after fork() and both processes get executed simultaneously.

2. vfork() :
        Vfork() is also system call which is used to create new process.
        New process created by vfork() system call is called child process and process that invoked vfork() system call is called parent process.
        Code of child process is same as code of its parent process. 
        Child process suspends execution of parent process until child process completes its execution as both processes share the same address space.

3. exec()
        The exec family of functions replaces the current running process with a new process.
        It can be used to run a C program by using another C program
